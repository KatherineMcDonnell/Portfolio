            <h2>BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND, 1776</h2>
            <p>What was it like when Washington and his American forces fled New York City under the cover of darkness?</p>
            <p>Through my summer 2024 internship building a video game of Manhattan throughout history, 
            I focused on bringing the most notable events in Manhattan’s history to life, so people today can relive them, learn about them, and interact with history in a tangible way.</p>

                <h3>The Work</h3>
                <p>From ideation to iteration to final design, I facilitated the creative and 
                technical components of this work, determining visual details and creating a 
                story flow for users. Leading and managing an international team of designers, developers, and programmers, I worked alongside professionals to create an immersive view of Manhattan’s long history.</p>

    <h3>The Ships of Manhattan</h3>
    <div class="section-work">
        <p><strong>Task:</strong> Determine what British ships were present in New York Harbor during the Battle of Long Island to create an immersive playable game level with historic accuracy.</p>
        <p><strong>Method:</strong> Primary accounts from the battle, British naval records, artist renditions of different ship types.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> How do I inform our design team of the key ships involved in the battle and of the different types of designs that 18th Century ships had?</p>
        <p><strong>Insights:</strong> By creating a "wikipedia" page in our GitHub repository, the design team can receive visuals and information on what 3-D assets to create.</p>
        <h3>The Half Moon and Ships of the Revolution</h3>
            <p>In September of 1609, Henry Hudson and his crew on the Dutch Halve Maen (Half Moon, in English) sailed into what would later become New York Harbor. Fast forward almost 200 years in the future, to when British naval forces laid siege to Manhattan during the Revolutionary War.</p>
            <p>Using primary accounts, modern reconstructions, and historic depictions, we compiled an online wikipedia of the ships that made Manhattan.</p>
