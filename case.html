                <h2>CONSULTING CASE STUDY</h2>
                <p>As a consultant with Students Consulting for Nonprofit Organizations (SCNO), I was tasked with creating a prioritization and scalability metric for a Chicago-based nonprofit to expand its services.</p>

            <h3>The Ships of Manhattan</h3>
            <div class="section-work">
                <p><strong>Task:</strong> Determine what British ships were present in New York Harbor during the Battle of Long Island to create an immersive playable game level with historic accuracy.</p>
                <p><strong>Method:</strong> Primary accounts from the battle, British naval records, artist renditions of different ship types.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> How do I inform our design team of the key ships involved in the battle and of the different types of designs that 18th Century ships had?</p>
                <p><strong>Insights:</strong> By creating a "wikipedia" page in our GitHub repository, the design team can receive visuals and information on what 3-D assets to create.</p>
                <h3>The Half Moon and Ships of the Revolution</h3>
                    <p>In September of 1609, Henry Hudson and his crew on the Dutch Halve Maen (Half Moon, in English) sailed into what would later become New York Harbor. Fast forward almost 200 years in the future, to when British naval forces laid siege to Manhattan during the Revolutionary War.</p>
                    <p>Using primary accounts, modern reconstructions, and historic depictions, we compiled an online wikipedia of the ships that made Manhattan.</p>
